# Student Facial Recognition Project

# Idea/Motivation
   The idea of this project was to make the life of students in LaGuadia Community College (LAGCC) easy. In order to enter any school building in school, students have to show their student ID cards to the security guard. 

## Problems
 * The problem with this was sometimes student would forget their ID cards and this could cause a whole lot of verification and unnecessary delays . 

* Another problem with this is that students would show their ID cards over and over again to the security guards at each building they enter.

## Solution
After identifying the problem, we came out with this program:

 * This program detects and recognizes students of LAGCC in our database.
 * It draws a GREEN rectangle over a LAGCC student who is in our dataset and outputs "Student Identified" and draws a RED rectangle over any other person who is not in our database and then prints out "Unidentified Person" and also plays "warning sound" to alert the security guard.

## Note
  See images in the repository for the output.
